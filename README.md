Option 1:
  - You can just download the index.html file, style2.css, and script.js file to see what the visuals for it will look like and without having to setup much stuff

Option 2:
  - You can download the spotify-profile-demo folder and use that.
  - In order to run it, you'll either have to get in contact with me so I can add you to my Spotify App, which will grant you access to use it or make your Spotify App and replace
the client id with your App's client id.
  - In addition to that, you'll have to dowload Node.js and setup some stuff if you run into errors
  - If you run into errors, you might have to follow this tutorial: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/howtos/web-app-profile
  - Once you get to the [Creating the user interface] section, you can stop and just copy the index.html, style2.css, and spotscript.js into
the spotify-profile-demo profile you just made.  My files (style2.css) and (spotscript.js) will just be added, they won't replace anything.

Running Spotify-Profile-Demo Folder:
1.) Open terminal and type these things:
2.) cd [Your File Location Here]
3.) cd [until you get to the folder that has spotify-profile-demo]
4.) cd spotify-profile-demo
5.) npm run dev
6.) Open http://localhost:5173/

If you run into Errors do this:
1.) Make sure you have node.js installed
2.) Type into a terminal:  npm create vite@latest spotify-profile-demo -- --template vanilla 
3.) Type in terminal:  cd spotify-profile-demo 
4.) Type in terminal:  npm install 
5.) Type in terminal:  npm run dev
6.) Then replace your (index.html) with my (index.html)
7.) Add my (style2.css) and (spotscript.js) into the spotify-profile-demo folder
8.) Then try running the folder again (also make sure you either contact me for access to Spotify App or replace client ID with your's)
