Option 1:
  - You can just download the index.html file, style2.css, and script.js file to see what the visuals for it will look like and without having to setup much stuff

Option 2:
  - You can download the spotify-profile-demo folder and use that.
  - In order to run it, you'll either have to get in contact with me so I can add you to my Spotify App, which will grant you access to use it or make your Spotify App and replace
the client id with your App's client id.
  - In addition to that, you'll have to dowload Node.js and setup some stuff if you run into errors
  - If you run into errors, you might have to follow this tutorial :https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/howtos/web-app-profile
  and just copy the index.html
